## Embedding the Chatboc widget

You can embed the floating chat widget on any site by loading `widget.js` and passing your token. Example:

```html
<script>
  (function () {
    var s = document.createElement('script');
    s.src = 'https://www.chatboc.ar/widget.js';
    s.async = true;
    s.setAttribute('data-token', 'TU_TOKEN_AQUI');
    // Optional: force light or dark theme
    // s.setAttribute('data-theme', 'dark');
    document.head.appendChild(s);
  })();
</script>
```

This snippet loads the widget without needing an iframe and creates a floating bubble styled just like on chatboc.ar.
You can also pass `data-theme="dark"` or `data-theme="light"` to force a specific theme inside the widget.

## Live ticket location

The application displays a map only when the backend provides location
information. Each ticket must include either numeric `latitud` and
`longitud` fields or a text `direccion`. While a ticket chat is open,
the frontend polls `/tickets/{tipo}/{id}` every ten seconds and updates
the map with any new coordinates received. If no coordinates are
returned, the map remains hidden.

To see realâ€‘time tracking, ensure the backend periodically sends the
current coordinates for each ticket. Once those values are present, the
map will refresh automatically without additional frontend changes.
